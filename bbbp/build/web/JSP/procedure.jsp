 A prospective parent can register online through the child adoption resource information and guidance system and check for children legally available for adoption according to age, language and other criteria. The Central Adoption Resource Authority, the nodal agency for adoption in India, has created a database of children available for adoption and has connected with adoption agencies across the country. 
Non-resident Indians will be treated as Indians in terms of priority and not as foreign nationals. At present, only 20% of children given for adoption go to NRI homes. There are an estimated 10,000 parents who would like to adopt. 

The new rules have also laid down criteria for prospective parents. Couples will have to be in a stable marital relationship for at least a year to adopt and the minimum age difference between the child and either parent should not be less than 25 years. Single women can adopt children of either gender but single men will not be eligible to adopt a girl child. The maximum age of a single prospective parent is 45 years if he or she wants to adopt a child of up to fours years of age. The ministry has capped the age of the parent at 55 years for adopting a child above eight years. It has also laid down a timeframe for the process of adoption.
