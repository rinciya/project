        <h1>Volunteer has successfully logged in!</h1>
        Volunteers come from different walks of life-students from various universities, professionals, housewives and people working in various companies.
We also welcome interns from different academic backgrounds.
CRY and its volunteers organise a number of events and workshops to spread awareness on Girl-child rights and various issues in India.
        We believe that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development, sustainable change will not happen. We encourage and invite volunteers to be an active part of our organization and share the same vision and purpose as us – to work for the welfare of children and their families. Volunteers are the backbone of every organization – they not only carry the organization’s ideals within them, but also spread the message far and beyond, sensitizing the society towards the cause.
